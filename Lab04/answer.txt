Programming with AWT and Swing is quite similar (similar elements including container/components, and
event-handling). However, there are some differences that you need to note:
o Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT
o Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding class’s name in Swing
o Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications
The resulting appearances of the applications developed using Swing and AWT might be different as well.
Make comparisons.

1. Top level containers in AWT are Frame, Dialog, Applet. Top level containers in Swing are JFrame, JDialog, JApplet, JWindow
   Top level containers in AWT are heavyweight since they rely on OS components, while Swing containers are lightweight because they are written entirely by Java
2. Class name in Swing has a prefix J
3. Swing builds on AWT’s event-handling model but improves it with better thread management (EDT) and a richer set of listeners
Comparison on appearances:
AWT: More "native" but limited and inconsistent across platforms
Swing: More versatile and consistent, but can look less native unless customized
