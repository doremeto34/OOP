Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
A: If both construct methods use only one parameter String and both title and category are String then JAVA won't allow doing this. Otherwise JAVA would accept as long as the two attributes use different data type

Q: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
A: Java a pass by value language
Q: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
A: The title of two objects remain because JAVA only passes object references by value
Q: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
A: Because dvd.setTitle(title) modifies the DigitalVideoDisc object that dvd refers to. The dvd variable is a copy of the reference to jungleDVD, so modifying dvd actually modifies jungleDVD directly.
