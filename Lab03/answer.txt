Q: Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they
initialize for their parts?
A:
Class Cart aggregates class Media
Class Shop aggregates class Media
Class CompactDisc aggregates class Track

Q: If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
Passing object different than Media would cause error.
Add "if (!(obj instanceof Media)) return false;" so the method return false on different class than Media to avoid error.

Q:What class should implement the Comparable interface?
A:The Media class should implement the Comparable interface as Book and Disc classes would inherit the comparison logic for sorting by title or cost
Q:In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that
we want?
A:We can override the compareTo() method for custom comparison
@Override
	public int compare(Media o1, Media o2) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		if(o1.getCost() == o2.getCost()) {
			if(o1.getTitle().equals(o2.getTitle())) return 0;
			return o1.getTitle().compareTo(o2.getTitle());
			
		}else
		if(o1.getCost() < o2.getCost()) return -1; else
		return 1;
	}
Q:Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
A:No, we can't have two ordering rules using Comparable interface since Comparable interface only allows one comparation rule with compareTo() method. Instead, we can use two Comparator classes
Q:Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then
decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
A:We can override the comparator for DVD class like this
@Override
  public int compareTo(Media DVD1, Media DVD2) {
    if(DVD1.getTitle().equals(DVD2.getTitle()) {
      if(DVD1.getLength() == DVD2.getLength()){
       return DVD1.getCost() > DVD2.getCost();
      }
      return DVD1.getLength() > DVD2.getLength();
    }
    return DVD1.getTitle() > DVD2.getTitle();
  }
